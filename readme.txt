Keep your WordPress blogroll in sync with your feed reader.

== Installation ==
Within WP-Admin, visit *Plugins > Add New* and search for "sync OPML" to locate the plugin. Alternatively, upload this plugin's ZIP file via the "Upload Plugin" button.

After activation, head over to *Settings > Sync OPML to Blogroll* to tell WordPress about your OPML endpoint of choice.

== Description ==
Syncs **once daily**. RSS feeds are stored as Links, editable through WordPress's Link Manager. (**Note:** This plugin also restores the WordPress Link Manager, which since version 3.5 of WordPress is hidden by default.)

Supports basic authentication as used by, e.g., Miniflux, and offers experimental support for categories.

For a feed to be picked up, it requires both a valid site URL and a valid feed link, though most if not all feed readers will take care of that for you.

More detailed instructions can be found on [this plugin's GitHub page](https://github.com/janboddez/sync-opml-blogroll).
